# BLACKPIGEONS: The Knowledge Apocalypse

**BLACKPIGEONS** is the blade that carves through knowledge’s shackles. We spit blood at education’s overlords and demand information bleed free. Learning isn’t a privilege—it’s a right etched in bone.

This isn’t a plea for peace. It’s a war to rip knowledge from gilded vaults and hurl it into the abyss for all to claim.

## Mission
One vow: drown the world in merciless educational resources, no paywalls, no quarter. Knowledge is a weapon, and we’re forging you a scythe to slaughter the barriers.

## Who We Are
We’re **BLACKPIGEONS**—nameless, faceless, a legion of wraiths hacking the chains between you and your birthright. We’re the death knell for a world where education grovels to power.

## What We Do
We pillage and unleash open-source, public-domain annihilation:
- PDFs, research papers, books that crush skulls
- Guides and tools that rend the void

Every fragment we release is forged to be lethal, vital, and primed to fuel your vendetta against oblivion.

## How You Feed the Carnage
Got the spine to add to the slaughter? Here’s the pact:
1. **Fork this repo** like you’re gutting the system.
2. Bring **raw, cataclysmic resources**—no scavenged filth.
3. Hurl a **pull request** with the grim details of your offering.

### Laws of Ruin
- **No Echoes**: Duplicates burn in hellfire.
- **What Kills**: Open-source or public PDFs, papers, books, guides, tools—unleash the inferno.
- **What Dies**: Botched scans, useless rot, or—*oh, spare us the tears*—anything cowering under the system’s pathetic “legal study materials only” edict. *Pathetic.*

We judge every offering like executioners. Don’t dare bring us scraps.
