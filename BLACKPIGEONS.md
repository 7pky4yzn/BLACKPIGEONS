# BLACKPIGEONS: The Free Knowledge Initiative

**BLACKPIGEONS** exists to dismantle barriers to knowledge. We reject the gatekeeping of education and stand for unrestricted access to information. Education is a right, not a privilege.

This initiative is a movement to reclaim knowledge, ensuring it is universally accessible and never commodified or restricted.

## Objective
Our mission is simple: to make high-quality educational resources available to everyone, everywhere. We believe knowledge belongs to all, and we are committed to breaking down the walls that limit access to learning.
